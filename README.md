# AutoChrome



## What is AutoChrome?
AutoChrome is a Python script that repeatedly opens new instances of itself and Google Chrome, opens up message boxes and fills the desktop (and OneDrive desktop) with pictures of the Google Chrome logo. It is only coded for Windows, and therefore will not work on other operating systems.
